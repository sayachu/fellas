Hey **\<fellas\>** and everyone else that stumbles upon this post.  
Iâ€™m going to talk a bit about the loot systems we have considered and what we finally settled on
for T5 raids to find a balance between utility, fairness and ease of use.

# The perfect loot system?

After lots of internal deliberation we settled on going with a **loot council**
consisting of multiple officers and a rotating guild member, which serves as a
small check and balance and ensure transparency on the process. Loot decisions have
to be unanimous and single people can veto them, if they deem them unfair.
Loot council systems can only be as fair as we are, but they are flexible, they
are quick, they are easy and they can be very transparent.

# Speeding up looting

With the positive experiences we made with the GoGoLoot addon, we want to take
some of this speedy looting into our council process. Loot will not be
distributed after every boss kill, but from bags during a break and after the
council decisions. You will still be able to vote through RCLootcouncil and
see who gets what, but the actual loot distribution happens all at once,
comfortably and quickly during small breaks where people can stretch their legs
and grab a drink, something that we probably should do more often anyway.

# Considerations we made and why we did not go with a DKP system

I was initially a big defender and friend of modified DKP systems, specifically
EPGP with sane settings like minimum EP and strong decay at around 20%. This would
ideally be the fairest loot system, but comes with a lot of setup and has the usual
downsides of DKP systems where too much equality gets in the way of individual needs,
that a "smart" loot council can adjust to.  

A DKP system would distribute loot more evenly, but it does not account for anything
past attendance and boss kills. Witha loot council we will take performance into
account, have gearing paths of classes in mind and will be much more prepared than
we are with Magtheridon heads, because we will have your full T5 BiS lists ahead of
time (more on that in another post) and before killing any boss.

# How can I be sure that you don't fuck me over?

We are aware that this demands a lot of trust in us as guild leaders to effectively
not gear our characters and leave you empty handed. Fellas has existed as a Mythic
raiding guild for 5 years now and loot drama has been minimal to non-existent. This
is our retail track record, that anyone that has raided with us can confirm.

As far as BCC goes we have ran with a soft reserve system and were happy with how quickly
and evenly it can distribute loot, so as an additional reassurance you have us running
raids and not interfering with a predetermined process that we deemed to be most
beneficial to everyone in the raid.

This mindset will not change going into future raid tiers and we will ultimately do what
we consider the best for the raid team and be as fair as possible, so everyone that
shows up and puts in the required effort, gets a chance to shine. We as a guild
are here to support you and provide you with gear, in return we expect you to perform
and most importantly, have fun doing so and consider being in **\<fellas\>** an enjoyable part
of your weekly commitments.
